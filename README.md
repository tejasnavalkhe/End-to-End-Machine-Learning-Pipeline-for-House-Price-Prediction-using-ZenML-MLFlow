# Building an End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for House Price Prediction using ZenML and MLflow
The project is focused on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a house price prediction system.

The pipeline is developed using ZenML, an MLOps Framework that helps in managing machine learning workflows, and MLflow, which is used for experiment tracking and model deployment.

The primary goal is to predict house prices based on various features of the house, such as size, location, and condition.
